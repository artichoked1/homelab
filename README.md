"Coma" is the name of my k8s cluster, named after the Coma Star cluster.
Used to have the "Pleiades" cluster as well until it kind of imploded on itself so I decided I should start again.

probably a bunch of things I did in here that are something along the lines of "blah blah bad practice... blah blah"
